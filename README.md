# Car Price Prediction
In this project, we will apply Exploratory Data Analysis to describe features and apply some statistical techniques. Also, we will perform a Linear Regression model in order to predict a variable from our data. <br/>

We choose the [Car Price Prediction Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ahmetcalis/car-price-prediction/data) from Kaggle to work on this project. Here are the steps that we are going to perform: <br/>





---



ðŸ“Œ Exploring the data and applying descriptive statistics methods. 

```bash
* Brief information about the data. 

* Apply some python codes to describe the data. 

* Picking one qualitative and one quantitative variable describing them by using the convenience statistical methods.

* Applying data visualization in order to get better understanding about the dispersion of these two variables selected before. 
* Providing a description about the distribution of variables based on the descriptive statistics and visualizations that we applied before. 

* Checking the missing values. 

* Examining the outliers.  
```

ðŸ“Œ Hypothesis Test. 

```bash
* Choosing one variable from the data and performing a Hypothesis Test by supporting all the steps with appropriate references, statistical concepts and conclusions. 

* Interpreting the results, prowiding our own analysis and a conclusion based on our Hypothesis Test.

```

ðŸ“Œ Correlation Analysis

```bash
* Applying a correlation analysis between 2 variables. 

* Interpreting the results and checking if the correlation implies causation. 

* Providing a conclusion based on the findings.  
```

ðŸ“Œ Linear Regression Model

```bash
* Building linear regression models for prediction. 

* Interpreting the results and providing a conclusion based on the findings. 
```

This project was applied togather with @MilaSoul.
